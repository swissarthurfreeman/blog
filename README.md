# Freeman's Blog

## Exercice project built with Node.js and a variety of dependencies. 

This blog was built following the book Beginning Node.js, Express & MongoDB Development.
It was my first serious web dev development, dating back to July 2020. 

Many of the skills I picked up here I re-used when building the University of Geneva's
automated locker rental website, which has the same tech stack except for MongoDB being
substituted by MySQL.
